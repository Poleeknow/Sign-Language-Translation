## About the Project 📖
The Sign Language Translator is an innovative project aimed at bridging the communication gap between deaf individuals and those unfamiliar with sign language. Utilizing advanced computer vision and natural language processing techniques, this project translates sign language from videos into written text. This breakthrough tool promises to enhance communication and accessibility for deaf individuals in a variety of settings.

## Project Files Overview 🗂️

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the Sign Language Translator project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-link-here.git
cd sign-language-translator
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```


3. **Install the required packages**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Running the Code

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
- Open the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
- Run the cells in sequence to preprocess the data.

2. **Model Analysis**:
- Open the `analitics_modelss.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
- Execute the cells to analyze various models and their performance.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
- Open the `model.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
- Run the cells to train and evaluate the sign language translation model.

### Note
- Make sure to adjust the file paths and configurations according to your local setup.
- If additional datasets or resources are required, ensure they are properly set up and accessible.

Now you're ready to explore and contribute to the Sign Language Translator project! 🌟
